# Jiny vs not Jiny Classification - Transfer Learning of CNN MobileNet Network
* The notebook contains image classification of dogs, where the classes are "Jiny" (my dog) and "Not Jiny" (other dogs).
* For this project, I used transfer learning from a pre-trained MobileNet network.
* This way, I was able to make a classifier with an accuracy of 99.23%, using not much computational power (only my home laptop) and a very small training set (70 images of Jiny and 200 images of other dogs).
* The images of Jiny are from my phone, and the images of the other dogs are from the "Dogs & Cats Images" dataset from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/chetankv/dogs-cats-images
